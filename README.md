## About the project.
This project simulates a particle engine using OpenGL and SDL. 
The ultimate goal is to simulate different effects such as fire effects, water splash, and many more.
I am still developing a more sustainable system that provides control to the user to simulate the effects as I do this in my free time. I will therefore provide a menu to allow control of the effects.

You can download the code and play with it however you want and thanks for checking it out

## Set up in your development environment

I used visual studio 2010 for development of the project.
To understand my setup, please watch the video above to see how I progressed about it.

Please also don't forget to download the SDL (1.2) development library  | https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php | to include in your project. For the setup with visual studio, see the video above.

You are free to use any of the files, like the light, textures, emitters etc in your code.

Thanks for checking out my work!
